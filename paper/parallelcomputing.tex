\section{Introduction}

\section{Why Parallel computing?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Huge data available (specially administrativa data) allow researchers and governments to replicate and inquire deeply in reality. Big data-ware houses are been built every where motive my open-data and transparency movements.
\item Impressive advances in GPU technologies taking computation into a whole new level through parallel computation. In less than ten years, the computational capabilities of a home computer have multiplied thousands of times\footnote{The new NVIDIA video card for laptos, GeForce GTX 680M, has 1344 cores.} 
\item Thus, the necessity of making assumptions such as ceteris-paribus is no longer necessary. Researchers can now simulate complete societies from the comfort of their desks just using mid capacity computers.
\end{itemize}
